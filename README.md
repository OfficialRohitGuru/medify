BotAI Project
Overview
The BotAI Project is a ReactJS web application that allows users to chat with an AI model and provide feedback on the conversation. Users can like/dislike AI responses, rate the conversation, and give subjective feedback. Additionally, users can review past conversations and feedback, and filter feedback across multiple conversations.

Features
Chat with AI: Users can engage in multiple conversations with the AI model.
Feedback on Responses: Users can provide thumbs up/down feedback on AI responses, which appear when hovering over the response.
End of Conversation Feedback: Users can rate the conversation out of 5 and provide subjective feedback.
Review Past Conversations: Users can revisit past conversations and view provided feedback.
Filter Feedback: Users can filter feedback based on rating in a dedicated view.
Light/Dark Mode: Users can toggle between light and dark modes for a better user experience.
